Mount the Optical Sensor on the meter body and fix it with the clamping screw. 
Important! The optical sensor housing must be positioned in a way that the internal cutout of the optical sensor housing is parallel to the meter counting mechanism. 
Pay Attention! There is a clip on the optical sensor cable indicating the module port number.  Connect the plug of the optical sensor to the mating connector of the radio module and fix it. After connecting the radio module generates the event “Activation” and sends it.  Hold the magnet closer to its body against the specially marked area for at least a few seconds (area is located in the bottom central part of the radio module body). 
While there is the magnetic influence, the radio module will transmit it’s current value of the pulse counter to all ports.
